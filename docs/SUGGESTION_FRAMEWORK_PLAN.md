# Bidirectional Suggestion Framework & Music Expert Review Plan

## Phase 1: Bidirectional Suggestion Framework

### 1.1 Architecture Design
The suggestion framework should intelligently detect:

#### A. "Key Provided But Unnecessary" Detection
**When to suggest removing parent key:**
- When functional/modal analysis produces identical results with and without key
- When confidence doesn't improve significantly (< 5% improvement)
- When Roman numerals are already available without the key
- When the key context adds chromatic complexity without benefit

**Implementation approach:**
```python
async def detect_unnecessary_key(chords, provided_key):
    # Run analysis WITH provided key
    with_key_result = analyze(chords, parent_key=provided_key)

    # Run analysis WITHOUT key
    without_key_result = analyze(chords, parent_key=None)

    # Compare results algorithmically
    if results_are_equivalent(with_key_result, without_key_result):
        return KeySuggestion(
            type="remove_key",
            reason="Parent key doesn't improve analysis",
            confidence_delta=calculate_delta()
        )
```

#### B. "Key Not Provided But Beneficial" Detection
**Already implemented but needs enhancement:**
- Detect ii-V-I, vi-IV-I-V patterns algorithmically (✅ done)
- Add detection for:
  - Secondary dominant sequences
  - Modal interchange patterns
  - Tonicization sequences
  - Chromatic voice leading patterns

### 1.2 Algorithmic Key Relevance Scoring

**Key Relevance Score Components:**
1. **Roman Numeral Availability** (0.3 weight)
   - Are Roman numerals available without key?
   - Do they improve with key?

2. **Confidence Delta** (0.2 weight)
   - How much does confidence improve?
   - Is the improvement meaningful (>15%)?

3. **Analysis Type Improvement** (0.2 weight)
   - Does it shift from modal to functional?
   - Does it clarify ambiguous progressions?

4. **Pattern Recognition** (0.3 weight)
   - Are common patterns detected with key?
   - Do patterns become clearer?

**Score Interpretation:**
- Score > 0.7: Strongly suggest key
- Score 0.4-0.7: Moderately suggest key
- Score 0.2-0.4: Weakly suggest (optional)
- Score < 0.2: Don't suggest (or suggest removal if key provided)

### 1.3 Implementation Steps

1. **Create KeyRelevanceAnalyzer class**
   - Systematic multi-key testing
   - Comparative analysis metrics
   - Bidirectional suggestion generation

2. **Enhance AlgorithmicSuggestionEngine**
   - Add unnecessary key detection
   - Add relevance scoring
   - Generate both "add key" and "remove key" suggestions

3. **Update AnalysisSuggestions type**
   - Add `unnecessary_key_suggestions` field
   - Add `key_relevance_score` field
   - Add suggestion confidence levels

## Phase 2: Music Expert Review Process

### 2.1 Review Methodology

Using the `music-theory-validator` agent to systematically review:

#### A. Functional Harmony Logic Review
**Review Points:**
- Chord function assignment accuracy
- Cadence detection algorithms
- Roman numeral generation
- Secondary dominant detection
- Chromatic chord handling
- Key determination algorithms

**Validation Questions:**
1. Are ii-V-I progressions correctly identified in all keys?
2. Are deceptive cadences properly detected?
3. Are borrowed chords correctly analyzed?
4. Are secondary dominants accurately identified?
5. Is the confidence scoring theoretically sound?

#### B. Modal Analysis Logic Review
**Review Points:**
- Modal characteristic detection
- Parent key/local tonic relationship
- Modal interchange identification
- Characteristic tone emphasis
- Modal cadence patterns
- Confidence calibration for modal context

**Validation Questions:**
1. Are modal characteristics (bVII, bIII, etc.) correctly identified?
2. Is the parent key + local tonic approach consistent?
3. Are modal cadences distinguished from functional ones?
4. Are mixed modal/functional progressions handled correctly?
5. Is confidence appropriately lower for ambiguous cases?

#### C. Chromatic Harmony Logic Review
**Review Points:**
- Chromatic mediant relationships
- Augmented sixth chord detection
- Neapolitan chord identification
- Chromatic voice leading
- Enharmonic reinterpretation
- Chromatic sequence detection

**Validation Questions:**
1. Are chromatic mediants correctly identified?
2. Are augmented sixth chords properly classified?
3. Is chromatic voice leading detected?
4. Are chromatic sequences recognized?
5. Is the chromatic complexity score accurate?

#### D. Orchestration Strategy Review
**Review Points:**
- Analysis priority (functional vs modal vs chromatic)
- Confidence weighting across analyzers
- Alternative generation thresholds
- Evidence aggregation methods
- Multi-interpretation handling

**Validation Questions:**
1. Is the correct analyzer prioritized for each progression?
2. Are confidence scores properly calibrated across analyzers?
3. Are alternatives generated when musically appropriate?
4. Is evidence properly weighted and aggregated?
5. Are edge cases handled gracefully?

### 2.2 Test Coverage Review

#### A. Function-Level Testing
- Each analyzer method has unit tests
- Edge cases are covered
- Error conditions are tested
- Performance benchmarks exist

#### B. Integration Testing
