## Documentation Maintenance

This documentation is organized to:
- **Reduce cognitive load** - Each file focuses on a specific domain
- **Enable quick reference** - Essential info remains in main CLAUDE.md
- **Provide deep-dive capabilities** - Detailed technical content available when needed
- **Maintain consistency** - Cross-references and consistent terminology throughout

When updating documentation:
1. Keep the main CLAUDE.md concise and focused on essentials
2. Place detailed technical content in appropriate specialized files
3. Update cross-references when moving or restructuring content
4. Ensure all documentation stays synchronized with code changes
